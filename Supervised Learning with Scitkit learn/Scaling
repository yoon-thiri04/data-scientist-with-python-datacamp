Two ways to scale the features of the model using sklearn
1. using StandardScaler
2. using Pipeline

It's important to scaling the features . Scaling is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. It involves transforming features to have a similar scale, which is crucial for many ml algorithms to perform optimally.


Why is Scaling Important?
Improves Model Performance:

Algorithm Sensitivity: Many machine learning algorithms, such as gradient descent-based methods (e.g., Logistic Regression, Linear Regression) and distance-based algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM), are sensitive to the scale of features. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model.
Convergence: Algorithms like gradient descent converge faster when features are on a similar scale, leading to more efficient training.

Ensuring fair Contribution:

Feature Influence: Without scaling, features with larger ranges or units can disproportionately influence the model. For example, if one feature is in the range of thousands and another in the range of ones, the model might favor the feature with larger values.

Distance Metrics:

Distance-Based Algorithms: Algorithms that rely on distance metrics, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or clustering algorithms, are affected by the scale of features. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to distance calculations.
Prevents Numerical Instability:

Stability: In some cases, features with large values can cause numerical instability in calculations, leading to poor performance or errors.

When to Use Scaling?
Before Model Training:

Gradient-Based Models: For algorithms that use gradient descent (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression), scaling is important to ensure stable and faster convergence.
Distance-Based Models: For algorithms that use distance metrics (e.g., KNN, K-Means), scaling ensures fair distance calculations.
When Features Have Different Scales:

Feature Variability: If features vary widely in scale or units, scaling is necessary to bring them to a similar range.
When Using Regularization:

Regularized Models: For models with regularization terms (e.g., Ridge or Lasso Regression), scaling ensures that regularization penalties are applied equally to all features.
